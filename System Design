gRPC is worth mentioning for internal service-to-service communication when performance is critical. It uses binary serialization and HTTP/2, 
making it significantly faster than JSON over HTTP. But you won't use it for public-facing APIs because browser support is limited. 
A common pattern is REST for external APIs and gRPC internally.
REST: It maps resources to URLs and uses HTTP methods to manipulate them

 Authentication, use JWT tokens for user sessions and API keys for service-to-service calls.

Load balancing : They just distribute connections without looking at the content.

Geography and latency : A request from New York to London has a minimum latency of around 80ms just from the speed of light through fiber optic cables,
before you even process anything. If your system needs low latency globally, you'll need regional deployments with data replicated or partitioned by geography.
This is why CDNs exist - to serve static content from edge servers close to users.

Data Modeling : 
Denormalization , For read-heavy systems where data rarely changes, this tradeoff is often worth it.

Caching : Use cases
 Read heavy workloads
 Expensive queries
 High database CPU
 Latency requrements
