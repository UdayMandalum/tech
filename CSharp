Var type : type conversion need to be explicit. For implicit conversion var type is used. type is infered by C# at complite time. use of var is required in LINQ
switch vs if. switch complies to a lookup table, allowing the allowing program to jump to the matching case, the expression is evaluated only once. 
 If evaluates conditions sequencially. should be used when condition to evaluate is complex and case are few, say 3 or less.
