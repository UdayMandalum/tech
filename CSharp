C# is trong type language 
Var type : type conversion need to be explicit. For implicit conversion var type is used. type is infered by C# at complite time. use of var is required in LINQ
switch vs if. switch complies to a lookup table, allowing the allowing program to jump to the matching case, the expression is evaluated only once. 
 If evaluates conditions sequencially. should be used when condition to evaluate is complex and case are few, say 3 or less. 
Strings, Array are reference types . Struct , Enumerations are value types
custom Types : Class, struct , Enumeration, Interface , Deligate
Enumeration : Giving name to a numerical value
Struct: Value type, similar to class like properties and methods. no garbage collection overheads. no unintended changes to original.
