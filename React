Reconcilation : react takes the copy of the DOM and compares what has changed and the difference is applied in brower 
so the entire DOM is not recreated unlike javascript
benefit is fast UI and better user experiance 

Component : javascript function that returns JSX , looks like HTML, alternative way to write js
JSX (Javascript Extension) : has hirarcy of components
Babel & SWC (Transpiler) tool coverts the JSX to JS for complier can understand
React DOM renders to html 

Components => JSX => Transpiler => Javascript => React DOM Library => HTML

Tools : Starting point sthat create templates , transforming JSX to JS, process JS for SPA , dev web server, auto browser updates
Vite , Next.js

Props : A way to pass arguments to components. Read only. Better reusability of components.
Prop types is used to specify the type of arg value being passed.  deprecated by Vite , instead use Type script.
key prop : When rendering a list , key prop helps React to identify which items have changed, been added, or remove, so rendering is efficient and in right order

Hooks: built in and custom. They are functions
