Reconcilation : react takes the copy of the DOM and compares what has changed and the difference is applied in brower 
so the entire DOM is not recreated unlike javascript
benefit is fast UI and better user experiance 

Component : javascript function that returns JSX , looks like HTML, alternative way to write js
JSX : has hirarcy of components
Babel & SWC (Transpiler) tool coverts the JSX to JS
React DOM renders to html 

Tools : Vite , Next.js


🧱 Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Visual Studio Code

Download from https://code.visualstudio.com

⚙️ Step-by-Step: Create and Set Up React Project
🔹 Step 1: Open VS Code Terminal
Open VS Code

Go to Terminal > New Terminal (or use shortcut Ctrl + `)

🔹 Step 2: Create a New React App
Use Vite (modern, fast) or Create React App (older, more bloated). Here's both:

👉 Option 1: Using Vite (Recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
Replace my-react-app with your project name.

Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd my-react-app
npm install
👉 Option 2: Using Create React App (CRA)
bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
🔹 Step 3: Open Project in VS Code
bash
Copy
Edit
code .
This opens the current folder (your React project) in VS Code.

🔹 Step 4: Install VS Code Extensions
Install these from the Extensions sidebar (or use the Extensions Marketplace):

🔹 ESLint – for linting JavaScript

🔹 Prettier - Code formatter – for consistent formatting

🔹 React Developer Tools – helps with JSX and React syntax

🔹 Simple React Snippets – handy code snippets for React

🔹 Step 5: Run the React Development Server
For Vite:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
For CRA:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Open browser at http://localhost:5173 (Vite) or http://localhost:3000 (CRA)

You should see the React welcome page!

🔹 Step 6: Start Coding
Open src/App.jsx (Vite) or src/App.js (CRA)

Modify JSX code — e.g., change <h1>Hello React!</h1>

Save the file and see live reload in browser
