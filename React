Reconcilation : react takes the copy of the DOM and compares what has changed and the difference is applied in brower 
so the entire DOM is not recreated unlike javascript
benefit is fast UI and better user experiance 

Component : javascript function that returns JSX , looks like HTML, alternative way to write js
JSX : has hirarcy of components
Babel tool coverts the JSX to JS
