Our IT team is responsible for building and maintaining applications that support the Indices business,
which creates and manages a wide range of indices across various asset classes â€” including fixed income (bonds, leveraged loans), as well as quantitative investment strategy (QIS) indices spanning equities, commodities, and foreign exchange (FX).

We support the entire data lifecycle and index production pipeline, which includes:

1. Data Ingestion:
We integrate with multiple internal and external data providers to extract critical datasets such as:

Market prices

Static instrument details (structures, identifiers, classifications)

Corporate actions and reference data

2. Data Processing & Storage:
Extracted data undergoes validation and transformation before being loaded into our internal databases. This ensures consistency and readiness for index computation.

3. Index Calculation Engine:
The processed data feeds into our index calculation engine, which computes complex index-level analytics, including performance, returns, risk metrics, and weights.

4. Analytics Aggregation:
We use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to aggregate and structure the analytics at the index and constituent level, enabling efficient querying and reporting.

5. Distribution:
The finalized index data and analytics are delivered to clients via:

Automated outbound feeds

An external-facing web portal, which provides interactive access to index constituents, historical data, and analytics
