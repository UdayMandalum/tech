Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope (global or function/block scope) during the compilation phase.
Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted

create variable with keyword, let, const, var
var: Function-scoped or globally-scoped. It can be redeclared and updated. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined.
let: Block-scoped (within {}). It can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope. It is also hoisted but accessing it before the declaration results in a ReferenceError (known as the "temporal dead zone").
const: Block-scoped. It cannot be redeclared or updated after its initial assignment. For objects and arrays, the reference cannot be changed, but their properties/elements can be modified. 

== (loose equality): Checks for value equality, performing type coercion (automatically converting types) before comparison.
Example: 3 == "3" is true.
=== (strict equality): Checks if both the value and the type are the same without any type conversion.
Example: 3 === "3" is false. 

has GC, uses dynamic typing 
datatypes : 
Primitives , stored on stack , immutible , passed by value : Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, Symbol, Nuklk , Undefined
Objects : on heap, passed by ref : Olain objects, Functions, Collections, Dates, Class instances, Errors, Promises

Map (object): Any datatype can be used as a key , like C# Dictionary . This is different than array.map 
Set : has unique set of values , like C# Hashset

Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
A Promise can be in one of three states: 
Pending: Initial state; the operation has not completed yet.
Fulfilled (Resolved): The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure (an error).
Once a promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected), it cannot change states again.
