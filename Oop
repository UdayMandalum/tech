4 pillars

Encapsulation : Containing information inside object, exposing certain info
    Avoid data curruption from unintended changes, using private public access
Abstraction : create a abstraction layer hiding details of class . Simple interface to interact with object.
    Expose only essential features and hide complexity from user
                Encapsulation        	                            Abstraction
Purpose:        Protect data by hiding implementation	    Hide complexity by showing only essentials
How it's done:	Access modifiers (private, public)	        Abstract classes, interfaces
Focus:        	Data protection	                            Behavior simplification
Example:    	Private fields with getters/setters	        Abstract methods, interfaces
Real-world analogy	Medicine bottle with a sealed cap	Car pedal (you press, not knowing how it works)

Inheritance : reuse the functionaly from others. 
Polymophism : Multiple forms can be given a method. e.g. Method overriding . 
              Virtual method of base class can be overriden in child class

Property to access object data
Composition : a class contained with another class

Interface : A contract. Class with only signatures. Implemented by class

 Scenario-Based / Practical Questions
Design a class structure for a payment system that supports multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

If you had to build a plugin-based architecture for file parsers (XML, JSON, CSV), how would you use interfaces or abstract classes?

How would you test a method that relies heavily on polymorphism?

In a microservices setup, how would you ensure encapsulation of domain logic?
