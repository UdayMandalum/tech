Compiled to bytecode , then interpreted      https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
The Execution Workflow
Source Code (.py): You write human-readable code.
Compilation: Python checks if a matching .pyc file exists and is up-to-date. If not, it compiles the .py file into bytecode.
Storage (.pyc): The bytecode is saved in the __pycache__ folder.
Interpretation: The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) reads the bytecode and executes it. 

Python Interpretor : e.g. Python 3.13.7 . To select click on View => Command Pallet OR Ctrl + Shift + P => Python: Select Interpreter
DataTypes : Python infers the type int, float . amount = int(10.6) . amount = float(10) . string : name = "my code" . myname = input("whats your name")

Python Standard library : The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be 
inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming
Has build it functions, types , modules
import (module name) , e.g. import random

List : words = ["LOL",'IDK","TBH"]   list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
.append .remove 
Similar to C# List<> :Indexed, mutable, allows duplicates, ordered

Tuples are like ValueTuples , immuttable list. Numerical index only
namedtuple is a subclass of tuple with named fields .Both numerical index and field name
defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class that automatically provides a default value for a non-existent key instead of raising a KeyError

match is like switch statement 

json.dumps() 	Python object to JSON
json.loads() JSON to Python object

import asyncio
async def get_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return 5
asyncio.run(get_data())

A dataclass is a regular Python class that uses the @dataclass decorator to automatically generate "boilerplate" methods—like __init__
Dataclasses are best for data containers, while regular classes are suited for complex logic or more control

database driver : pip install pyodbc . pip install pymongo
