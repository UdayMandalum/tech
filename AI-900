I AI workloads and consideration
AI copies the human behaviour and actions, making predictions with ML

Anolamy detection : ML to analyze data over time and identify unusual changes, deviation from standard pattern
Knowledge mining : Extracting information from large volumes of data. Great for unstructured files by injesting documents. 
Computer vision : How Ai sees the world. object detection , text from images. e.g. Facial recognition 
Natural Language Processing NLP :  Software to understand spoken and written lanuages. Speech recognition & speech sysnthesis, speech translation. Postive & negative text tone
Generative AI : AI that can create original content such as text , images and code . Uses Large Language Model
   
Creating Responsible AI ( 6 Principles)
Fairness , Reliability and Safety , Privacy and Security, inclusiveness, Transparency , Accountability

II Machine Learning on Azure
Az Services : Az automated Machine Learning, Az machine learning designer
Supervised machine learning uses Regression and classification 

1. Regression : Predicting a numerical value based on historical data (dataset). features (inputs) and label (value to find out)
feature engg: creating new features based on existing one 

2. Classification : Category or class that item belongs to. 
Binary : eg. a person is high or low risk for loan 
Multi-class : eg. analyzing someones mood

3. Clustering (Unsupervised) : Group similar items based on similarities , not pridicting anything , no historical data available

4. Deep Learning: Uses artificial nural network , machine self trains itself
Need large amount of data, high end machines, slow to train, have multiple formats. 
Identifying patterns in unstructured data like object detection , text to speech detection

Depploying a Model using Az automated Machine Learning
Model performance : R2 score , 0-1 , higher is better in prediction
Root mean squared log err, larger meaning more errors

Data preparation
Cleaning
Normalization: converting the values to same sclae of 0-1
Splitting

Model deployment : via Inference Pipelines
can be deployed to Az Kubernetes (prefered for non-testing scenario) or containers (prefered for testing)

Training our Models
Pick Alorithm like fast training liner regression algorithm
Validation : to check how model is performing in prediticting the label. Data is split for training and validation. 

Az machine learning designer pipeline : drag and drop modules via screen . Takes several steps compared to Automated ML

Classification Models
Confusion matrix is used to score and evaluate a classification model
            Positive    Negative
Positive   True +ve     False -ve
Negative   False -ve   True -ve
