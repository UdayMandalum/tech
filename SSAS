Multidimensional Cube is not supported in Azure Analysis Service, only supports tabular models

Multidimensional : Measures, Dimension, cube . MDX 
Tabular 	 : Column, Table , model . DAX

Measure : Numerical data to be analyzed e.g. counts, sums, averages .. 
Dimensions : Provides context to numerical values like people, things, places
look for word "by" . e.g. qnty sold by date, customer, color 

MOLAP : Data is stored in cube. Fast response, but more processing time.
ROLAP : Data stored in underlining databases. Slower response

Dimentional Modeling : 
Fact Table : Many columns of numeric data. 
Dimention Table : will have a forign key in Fact table

Modelling Approach : OLTP (Transactional, 3rd normalized level, fater writes) & OLAP (Analytical, Denormalized , faster read)
